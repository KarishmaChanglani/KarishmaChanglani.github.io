<p>  Hello there! My name is Karishma Changlani and 
I am sophomore at Drexel University studying for BS in 
Computer Science. While my interests in CS lie mainly in 
Machine Learning and Game Engineering I find the entire 
field of computing very intriguing. You can look at my 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pdf/resume.pdf" target="_blank"> resume </a> 
to learn more about my projects and skills.
</p>

<p>
I am heavily interested in Digital Art and Fantasy 
writing. To ask more use the <a href="contact.html" > contact page </a>
or email me at karishmachanglani@gmail.com
I love sharing my interests and experiences in all 
the above fields.

You can even learn more about my everyday experiences and views, especially those
those related to CS and Digital Art on my <a href="..\"> 
blog </a> or check out my <a href="https://doodler0305.deviantart.com"> gallery </a> 
for more of my art.
