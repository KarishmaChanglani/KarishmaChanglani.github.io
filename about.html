<p>  Hello there! My name is Karishma Changlani and 
I am sophomore at Drexel University studying for BS in 
Computer Science. While my interests in CS lie mainly in 
Machine Learning and Game Engineering I find the entire 
field of computing very intriguing. You can look at my 
<a href="pdf/resume.pdf" target="_blank"> resume </a> 
to learn more about my projects and skills.
</p>

<p>
I am heavily interested in Digital Art and Fantasy 
writing. To ask more use the <a href="contact.html" > contact page </a>
or email me at karishmachanglani@gmail.com
I love sharing my interests and experiences in all 
the above fields so please feel free to drop by a message. 
</p>

<p>
You can even learn more about my everyday experiences and views, especially those
those related to CS and Digital Art on my <a href="https://digitallyartistic.wordpress.com/"> 
blog </a> or check out my <a href="https://doodler0305.deviantart.com"> gallery </a> 
for more of my art.
