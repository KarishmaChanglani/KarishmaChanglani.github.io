Hello everyone my name is Karishma Changlani. You can find out more about me in the What is this? 
section of this blog or check out my <a title="website" href="http://www.karishmachanglani.me">website</a>:

So since this is the very first blog post, I thought I should start with something that has been close to my 
heart for the longest time, Fractal Art. All my fans of recursion this one is for you.

For those of you who don't know what a Fractal is:

It is basically a geometric figure who parts represent the whole. Meaning if you cut a part of it you will get 
that exact same figure as the whole. They are created by repeating the same job over and over again in feedback loop.

Unlike your normal shapes like circles and squared defined by fixed characteristics and formula, these are defined by iterations.

To learn more you can check out my <a title="Fractals: An infinite fascination"

 by George Dallas.

Now that is a Fractal, but what is a Fractal Art (or Fractal Expression as some like to call it)?.

Fractal Art by definition is by calculating fractal objects and representing the results in medias like images 
and animations. Representing these calculations on paper accurately is nearly impossible making Fractal Art one
 of the most unique forms of Digital Art. However its implication lay way beyond pretty complex looking images. 
 It goes deeper into the realistic applications of Fractal Art. One of the main reasons why fractal art is so 
 fascinating to so is because they closely represent naturally occurring objects. Much more accurately than 
 standard geometry ever did.

Fractal Art is representing these images making it much easier to perceive and them in real life. Examples if this include:

These not only serve to form a artistic representations but also help us observe fractals taking a more and more accurate 
representation of reality. A classic example of this is the real island of Sark.

So what do you think of Fractal Art. Do you believe that it is a good way to explore further into this field of mathematics
 or is it just random shapes that are somewhat cool? What do you think of the term Fractal Expression? Comment below and 
 let me know. Also feel free to subscribe to this blog as I will be posting a personal entry the first full weekend of every month.
